              I currently work at <span>Ework Group</span> where I write code on
              the frontend using the <span>React.js</span> library. Along with
              other teams, we manage a Storybook where we keep common components
              for our projects. In addition to writing new business solutions,
              we are also rewriting the application using
              <span>React Query</span> to retrieve and update data and
              <span>Zod</span> for schema validation in TypeScript. We work in a

              master and project manager.

              Before I decided to become a frontend developer I was working on
              3D models. I worked in <span>CAD</span> programs such as
              <span>Catia V5</span> and <span>Inventor.</span>
              It was mainly in the automotive sector where I designed components
              for cars and tools for manufacturing components. I was in constant
              contact with project managers and production workers. Together we
              caught up on projects from paper to final product. If everything
              passed the tests successfully then the project went into series
              production.
